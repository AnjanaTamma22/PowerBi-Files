This project analyzes and visualizes the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the United States from 2016 to 2023. It combines EV purchase data with carbon emission statistics to provide valuable insights into EV trends and their environmental impact across various U.S. states. The dashboard, built using Power BI, includes multiple visualizations such as:

- EV Purchases Over Time: A time-series graph showing the growth of total EV purchases and the share of EVs in total vehicle sales from 2016 to 2023.
- EV Adoption Rate vs. Carbon Emission: A dual-axis chart comparing the percentage increase in EV adoption against the carbon emissions per state from 2016 to 2022.
- Top U.S. States by EV Adoption Rate: A map visualization highlighting the states with the highest EV adoption rates, providing insight into regions leading the shift towards electric transportation.
- EV Categories: Breakdown of EV purchases into categories such as Electric Vehicles (EV), Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV), and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).
- Year-on-Year Growth: A graph that demonstrates the annual growth in EV purchases, showcasing the accelerated adoption of EVs in recent years.
- EV Purchases by State: A bar chart that ranks U.S. states by total EV purchases, with California standing as the dominant leader in EV adoption.

Key Features:
- Interactivity: Filters and slicers to explore different years and adoption categories.
- Insights: Comparison between incentivized and non-incentivized states for EV adoption.
- Environmental Impact: Correlation between EV adoption rates and carbon emissions, enabling insights into the environmental benefits of EV adoption.

Technologies:
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- Data sourced from public EV adoption and carbon emissions datasets.
